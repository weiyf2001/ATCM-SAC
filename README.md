## üå§Ô∏è ATCM-SAC

### Description
The ATCM-SAC framework consists of three parts, including the marine environment model, the USV model and the trajectory planning model.

ATCM (Adaptive Trajectory Control Module) is designed based on the transformer architecture for advanced feature extraction and adaptive fusion, which enables the agent to dynamically adjust the weight of attention and the allocation of information sources in different scenarios.

## üìä CMEMS Dataset

### Description
The **CMEMS Dataset** from the Copernicus Marine Environment Monitoring Service provides global historical ocean data at high spatial and temporal resolution. It provides data related to ocean currents and waves, serving as the backbone for training the RL model.
